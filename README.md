# Instagram-follow-back-checker
This is a python script that checks accounts you follow that do not follow you back.

This is something I made in a couple mins after seeing a TikTok vid that had some code. The code in the vid required u downloading your data from instagram which takes a while so I thought I could make it a bit more efficient. This uses the instagrapi and probably would not work on accounts with 2fa enabled accounts, I can try to make that more accessible.

You should not run this much within a short period of time or instagram will think your account was hacked and suspend it.
